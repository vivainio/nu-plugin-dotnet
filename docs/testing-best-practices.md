# Nushell Testing Best Practices for Nu-Plugin-DotNet

This document outlines modern Nushell testing patterns and how they can be applied to improve plugin testing.

## Current Testing Approaches in Nushell (2025)

### 1. **Official Nushell Testing** (`std assert`)

The recommended approach using Nushell's built-in standard library:

```nu
use std assert

def "test my-function" [] {
    # Arrange
    let input = "test data"
    let expected = "expected result"
    
    # Act
    let actual = (my-function $input)
    
    # Assert
    assert ($actual == $expected)
    assert ($actual | str contains "expected")
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Uses AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Part of Nushell standard library
- Simple, reliable assertion syntax
- Built-in error reporting

### 2. **Advanced Testing** (`nutest` framework)

For complex testing scenarios with setup/teardown:

```nu
@before-all
def setup [] {
    print "Setting up test environment"
}

@test
def "should create object successfully" [] {
    use std assert
    let result = (dn new "System.Text.StringBuilder")
    assert ($result | str contains "StringBuilder")
}

@after-all
def cleanup [] {
    print "Cleaning up test environment"
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Test annotations (`@test`, `@before-each`, `@after-each`)
- Concurrent test execution
- Structured test reporting
- Flexible test filtering

## Comparison: Old vs Modern Approaches

### Old Approach (Our Legacy Tests)

```nu
#!/usr/bin/env nu

print "Testing dn new command..."

# Basic test with manual error handling
try {
    let result = (dn new "System.Text.StringBuilder")
    if ($result | str contains "StringBuilder") {
        print "✅ Test passed"
    } else {
        print "❌ Test failed"
        exit 1
    }
} catch { |e|
    print $"❌ Error: ($e.msg)"
    exit 1
}

exit 0
```

**Issues:**
- Manual success/failure tracking
- Verbose error handling
- Hard to maintain
- No structured assertions
- Exit code dependency

### Modern Approach (Recommended)

```nu
#!/usr/bin/env nu

use std assert

def "test StringBuilder creation" [] {
    # Arrange
    let type_name = "System.Text.StringBuilder"
    
    # Act
    let result = (dn new $type_name)
    
    # Assert
    assert (($result | describe) == "string")
    assert ($result | str contains "StringBuilder")
}

def main [] {
    let tests = [
        "test StringBuilder creation"
    ]
    
    for test in $tests {
        try {
            do $test
            print $"✅ ($test)"
        } catch { |e|
            print $"❌ ($test): ($e.msg)"
        }
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear test structure with AAA pattern
- Built-in assertion library
- Automatic error reporting
- Easy to extend and maintain
- Follows Nushell conventions

## Best Practices Implementation

### 1. **Test Organization**

```
tests/
├── mod.nu                    # Test module exports
├── basic-functionality.nu   # Core plugin tests
├── advanced-features.nu     # Complex scenarios
├── error-handling.nu        # Error cases
└── integration.nu           # End-to-end tests
```

### 2. **Assertion Patterns**

```nu
# Type checking
assert (($result | describe) == "string")
assert (($result | describe) | str contains "list")

# Content validation  
assert ($result | str contains "expected_text")
assert ($result == expected_value)

# Numeric comparisons
assert (($result | length) > 0)
assert ($result == 42)

# Boolean conditions
assert ($condition == true)
assert (not $condition)
```

### 3. **Error Testing**

```nu
def "test error handling" [] {
    try {
        dn new "Invalid.Type"
        assert false "Should have thrown an error"
    } catch {
        assert true "Correctly handled error"
    }
}
```

### 4. **Conditional Testing**

```nu
def "test optional feature" [] {
    let dll_path = "path/to/optional.dll"
    
    if ($dll_path | path exists) {
        # Run the test
        let result = (dn load $dll_path)
        assert ($result | str contains "success")
    } else {
        print "⏭️ Skipping test - dependency not found"
    }
}
```

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Create Modern Test Foundation
- Set up `tests/` directory structure
- Create basic test runner using `std assert`
- Implement core functionality tests

### Phase 2: Modernize Existing Tests
- Convert manual checks to `assert` statements
- Implement AAA pattern consistently
- Remove exit code dependencies

### Phase 3: Advanced Testing Features
- Add test categorization
- Implement setup/teardown patterns
- Add performance and integration tests

## Example: Complete Modern Test Suite

See `tests/simple-modern-tests.nu` for a complete implementation that demonstrates:

✅ **Working Examples:**
- Basic object creation testing
- Method call validation
- Property access verification
- Assembly operation testing
- Custom DLL integration testing
- Error handling validation

✅ **Best Practices Applied:**
- Uses `std assert` for all validations
- Implements AAA pattern consistently
- Provides clear, descriptive output
- Handles both success and error cases
- Includes conditional testing for optional features

## Test Execution

### Running Modern Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
nu tests/simple-modern-tests.nu

# Run specific test categories (if using modular approach)
nu -c "use tests/mod.nu; run-basic-tests"
nu -c "use tests/mod.nu; run-assembly-tests"
```

### Expected Output

```
🧪 Testing basic object creation...
  - Testing StringBuilder creation
    ✅ StringBuilder created successfully
  - Testing ArrayList creation
    ✅ ArrayList created successfully

🧪 Testing method calls...
  - Testing StringBuilder.Append
    ✅ StringBuilder.Append successful

🎉 Modern test suite completed!
✅ All core plugin functionality verified
```
