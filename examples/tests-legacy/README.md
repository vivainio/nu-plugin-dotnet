# Legacy Test Files

These are the original test files that were used before the migration to modern Nushell testing patterns.

## What Changed

- **Before**: Manual test validation with exit codes
- **After**: Modern `std assert` with structured test suites

## New Test Location

The modern test suite is now located in `/tests/` using:
- ✅ `std assert` for reliable assertions
- ✅ Modular test organization
- ✅ CI/CD ready structure
- ✅ Better error reporting

## Running Modern Tests

```bash
# From project root
nu run-tests.nu --suite all
```

## Migration Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Consistent assertion patterns
2. **Maintainability**: Clear test structure  
3. **Debugging**: Better error messages
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new tests

These legacy files are kept for reference but should not be used for new development.
