# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The main .NET plugin (nu-plugin-dotnet) is a comprehensive nushell plugin that provides seamless integration between nushell and the .NET ecosystem. It allows nushell users to create .NET objects, call methods, access properties, load assemblies, and explore types directly from their shell scripts. The plugin serves as a bridge between nushell's dynamic scripting environment and .NET's rich type system and extensive library ecosystem.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a nushell user, I want to create .NET objects from any loaded type, so that I can leverage .NET functionality in my shell scripts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use `dn new` with a type name THEN the system SHALL create an instance of that type and return a custom object reference
2. WHEN I provide constructor arguments THEN the system SHALL find a matching constructor and use the provided arguments
3. WHEN I specify an assembly path THEN the system SHALL load the assembly before attempting to create the object
4. WHEN the type supports generic syntax (e.g., "List[string]") THEN the system SHALL convert it to proper .NET generic type notation
5. WHEN no matching constructor is found THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message listing available constructors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a nushell user, I want to call methods on .NET objects and static methods on types, so that I can execute .NET functionality and get results back in nushell format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use `dn call` on a custom object THEN the system SHALL invoke the specified method on that object instance
2. WHEN I use `dn call` with a type name THEN the system SHALL invoke the specified static method on that type
3. WHEN I provide method arguments THEN the system SHALL convert nushell values to appropriate .NET types for the method call
4. WHEN the method returns a value THEN the system SHALL convert the result back to nushell-compatible format
5. WHEN the method is async (returns Task or Task<T>) THEN the system SHALL await the result and unwrap it properly
6. WHEN method overload resolution is needed THEN the system SHALL select the best matching overload based on argument types

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a nushell user, I want to access and modify properties and fields on .NET objects, so that I can read and write object state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use `dn get` with a property name THEN the system SHALL return the current value of that property
2. WHEN I use `dn get` with a field name THEN the system SHALL return the current value of that field
3. WHEN I use `dn set` with a property name and value THEN the system SHALL set the property to the specified value
4. WHEN I use `dn set` with a field name and value THEN the system SHALL set the field to the specified value
5. WHEN I access indexed properties (like arrays or collections) THEN the system SHALL support index-based access
6. WHEN the property or field doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a nushell user, I want to load .NET assemblies from files, so that I can use types from external libraries and custom DLLs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use `dn load` with an assembly file path THEN the system SHALL load the assembly into the plugin's context
2. WHEN I load an assembly THEN the system SHALL resolve its dependencies automatically where possible
3. WHEN I load the same assembly multiple times THEN the system SHALL reuse the already loaded assembly
4. WHEN the assembly file doesn't exist or is invalid THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message
5. WHEN assembly loading fails due to dependencies THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a nushell user, I want to explore loaded assemblies and their types, so that I can discover available functionality and understand the .NET objects I'm working with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use `dn assemblies` THEN the system SHALL list all currently loaded assemblies with their basic information
2. WHEN I use `dn types` THEN the system SHALL list all available types from loaded assemblies
3. WHEN I use `dn types` with an assembly filter THEN the system SHALL show only types from the specified assembly
4. WHEN I use `dn members` with a type name THEN the system SHALL show all public members (methods, properties, fields) of that type
5. WHEN I explore generic types THEN the system SHALL display them in user-friendly format with type parameters

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a nushell user, I want comprehensive error handling and helpful error messages, so that I can understand and fix issues when working with .NET objects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a .NET exception occurs during method calls THEN the system SHALL catch it and return a nushell error with the exception message
2. WHEN type conversion fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear information about the expected and actual types
3. WHEN assembly loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error details including file paths and dependency information
4. WHEN object references become invalid THEN the system SHALL detect this and provide appropriate error messages
5. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging information for troubleshooting

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a nushell user, I want automatic type conversion between nushell values and .NET types, so that I can work seamlessly without manual type casting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I pass nushell strings to .NET methods THEN the system SHALL convert them to appropriate .NET string types
2. WHEN I pass nushell numbers to .NET methods THEN the system SHALL convert them to appropriate numeric types (int, long, double, etc.)
3. WHEN I pass nushell lists to .NET methods THEN the system SHALL convert them to appropriate .NET collection types
4. WHEN I pass nushell records to .NET methods THEN the system SHALL convert them to appropriate .NET object types where possible
5. WHEN .NET methods return objects THEN the system SHALL convert them back to nushell-compatible formats
6. WHEN conversion is not possible THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages explaining the type mismatch

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a nushell user, I want object lifetime management, so that .NET objects persist across commands and are properly cleaned up when no longer needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a .NET object THEN the system SHALL assign it a unique identifier and keep it alive for subsequent commands
2. WHEN I reference an object by ID THEN the system SHALL retrieve the correct object instance
3. WHEN objects implement IDisposable THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms to dispose them properly
4. WHEN the plugin shuts down THEN the system SHALL clean up all managed objects appropriately
5. WHEN objects are no longer referenced THEN the system SHALL allow them to be garbage collected

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a nushell user, I want support for generic types and methods, so that I can work with strongly-typed collections and generic APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create generic types using user-friendly syntax (e.g., "List[string]") THEN the system SHALL convert to proper .NET generic notation
2. WHEN I call generic methods THEN the system SHALL infer type parameters where possible or allow explicit specification
3. WHEN I work with generic collections THEN the system SHALL maintain type safety and provide appropriate conversions
4. WHEN generic type constraints are violated THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
5. WHEN displaying generic types THEN the system SHALL show them in readable format with type parameters

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a plugin developer, I want the main plugin to use the protocol library, so that protocol handling is separated from business logic and the codebase is maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin starts THEN it SHALL use NushellProtocolHandler for all protocol communication
2. WHEN implementing command handlers THEN the plugin SHALL implement IPluginCommandHandler interface
3. WHEN processing commands THEN the plugin SHALL focus on .NET integration logic without protocol concerns
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the plugin SHALL rely on the protocol library for proper error formatting and communication
5. WHEN debugging THEN the plugin SHALL leverage the protocol library's logging capabilities
