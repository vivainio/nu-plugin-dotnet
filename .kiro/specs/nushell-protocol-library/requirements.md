# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The NuPluginDotNet.Protocol library is a standalone .NET library that implements the complete nushell plugin protocol, making it incredibly easy for .NET developers to create nushell plugins. The library abstracts away all the complexity of the nushell plugin protocol communication, allowing developers to focus solely on their plugin's business logic by implementing a simple 3-method interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a .NET developer, I want to create nushell plugins without understanding the complex plugin protocol, so that I can focus on my plugin's functionality rather than protocol implementation details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer implements the IPluginCommandHandler interface THEN they SHALL only need to implement 3-4 methods (HandleSignatureAsync, HandleMetadataAsync, HandleRunAsync, and optionally HandleSignalAsync)
2. WHEN a developer uses the NushellProtocolHandler THEN the library SHALL automatically handle all protocol communication with nushell
3. WHEN a developer creates a plugin using this library THEN they SHALL NOT need to understand JSON protocol details, message parsing, or encoding negotiation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a plugin developer, I want the library to handle all protocol errors gracefully, so that my plugin doesn't crash when communication issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a JSON parsing error occurs THEN the library SHALL catch the exception and return a properly formatted error response to nushell
2. WHEN an unhandled exception occurs in user code THEN the library SHALL convert it to a nushell-compatible error format
3. WHEN protocol communication fails THEN the library SHALL log the error and attempt graceful recovery
4. WHEN invalid messages are received THEN the library SHALL respond with appropriate error messages without crashing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a plugin developer, I want comprehensive debugging capabilities, so that I can troubleshoot protocol communication issues during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debug logging is enabled THEN the library SHALL log all incoming and outgoing protocol messages
2. WHEN debug logging is enabled THEN the library SHALL write logs to a temporary file with timestamps
3. WHEN protocol errors occur THEN the library SHALL log detailed error information including stack traces
4. WHEN debugging is disabled THEN the library SHALL NOT write any log files or impact performance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a plugin developer, I want the library to handle nushell signals (Interrupt, Reset), so that my plugin can respond appropriately to user actions like Ctrl+C.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN nushell sends an Interrupt signal THEN the library SHALL route it to the HandleSignalAsync method
2. WHEN nushell sends a Reset signal THEN the library SHALL route it to the HandleSignalAsync method
3. WHEN HandleSignalAsync is not implemented THEN the library SHALL provide a default no-op implementation
4. WHEN signal processing fails THEN the library SHALL NOT send error responses (as per protocol specification)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a plugin developer, I want strongly-typed helper classes for creating nushell values and command signatures, so that I can avoid manual JSON construction and reduce errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating nushell values THEN the library SHALL provide NuValues helper methods for all basic types (String, Int, Float, Bool, List, Record, Nothing, Error)
2. WHEN defining command signatures THEN the library SHALL provide CommandHelpers methods for creating signatures, positional arguments, and named arguments
3. WHEN using helper methods THEN they SHALL generate correctly formatted objects that match nushell's expected JSON structure
4. WHEN creating complex signatures THEN the library SHALL provide type-safe classes (CommandSig, PositionalArg, NamedArg) with proper validation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a plugin developer, I want the library to handle the complete plugin lifecycle, so that I don't need to manage protocol handshaking or message routing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin starts THEN the library SHALL automatically send the required Hello message with proper protocol version
2. WHEN nushell responds with Hello THEN the library SHALL validate the handshake and log successful completion
3. WHEN Call messages are received THEN the library SHALL route them to appropriate handler methods based on call type
4. WHEN the plugin shuts down THEN the library SHALL handle Goodbye messages and clean up resources properly

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a plugin developer, I want the library to be compatible with current nushell versions, so that plugins built with this library work with users' nushell installations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN used with nushell 0.104.0 or later THEN the library SHALL communicate successfully using the JSON protocol
2. WHEN protocol version negotiation occurs THEN the library SHALL declare compatibility with "nu-plugin" protocol
3. WHEN response formats change between nushell versions THEN the library SHALL handle backward compatibility appropriately
4. WHEN new protocol features are added THEN the library SHALL gracefully ignore unsupported features

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a plugin developer, I want comprehensive documentation and examples, so that I can quickly understand how to use the library effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developers read the README THEN they SHALL find complete quick-start instructions with working code examples
2. WHEN developers need reference information THEN they SHALL find detailed interface documentation with parameter descriptions
3. WHEN developers want to see working examples THEN they SHALL find complete example projects in the repository
4. WHEN developers encounter issues THEN they SHALL find troubleshooting guidance and debugging instructions
